## Tempest
Software to run automated blinds

Features to add
- If you double click into reset mode, you can't get out unless you update the min and max points Make it so you only have to update min and max points if you move the blind outside it's current min max and don't set anything
- Add sound so when you set min and max it makes a sound
- Current bug where the blind doesn't go the exact same position every time it goes up and down. It has some drift


Things to do
- Move all the library files to new folder
- Try change Ids to be structs and see if that works well
- Do a review of the code and think about how to structure the code better
- Design new encoder in KiCAD -> use new BJTs, use BJT to amplifier current
    through the IR so it reaches the distance
